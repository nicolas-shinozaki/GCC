# 3.6: Get Help in the Command Line

## Scenario
In this scenario, you have to find more information about commands that you need to use. You also need to discover which command to use to perform a certain task.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll explore a few commands you can use in the shell to learn more about other commands. Next, you’ll find an option you need to add to a command. Third, you’ll use a command to get a brief description of commands so you can identify their differences. Finally, you’ll identify the command you need to perform a task.


### Task 1. Learn more about commands
1. Run the whatis command to get a short description of cat.
```
analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ whatis cat
cat (1)              - concatenate files ...
Use the man command to get more details about cat.
analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ man cat

head (1)             - output the first p...
```

### Task 2. Explore the useradd command
1. Use the most appropriate Linux command to get help on the useradd command and learn more about all of its options.
```
analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ man useradd
USERADD(System Management CommanUSERADD(8)

NAME
       useradd - create a new user or
       update default new user information

```

### Task 3. Explore the rm and rmdir commands
1. Use the most appropriate Linux command to quickly remind yourself what each command does.
```
analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ whatis rmdir
rmdir (1)            - remove empty direc...
rmdir (2)            - delete a directory
analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ whatis rm
rm (1)               - remove files or di...
```

### Task 4. Determine which command to use
1. Use the most appropriate Linux command with these keywords to identify what command to use.

analyst@e526ccf2e8d2:~$ apropos -a create new group
groupadd (8)         - create a new group
```
