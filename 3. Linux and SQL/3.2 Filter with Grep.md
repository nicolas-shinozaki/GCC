# 3.2: Filter with Grep

## Scenario

In this scenario, you need to obtain information contained in server log and user data files. You also need to find files with specific names.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and return the error messages in the server_logs.txt file. Next, you’ll navigate to the users directory and search for files that contain a specific string in their names. Finally, you’ll search for information contained in user files.


### Task 1. Search for error messages in a log file
1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ cd /home/analyst/logs
```

2. Use grep to filter the server_logs.txt file, and return all lines containing the text string error.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ grep error server_logs.txt
```

### Task 2. Find files containing specific strings
1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ cd /home/analyst/reports/users
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ ls | grep Q1
Q1_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt
```

2. List the files that contain the word access in their names.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ find -name "*access*"
```

### Task 3. Search more file contents
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ ls /home/analyst/reports/users
Q1_access.txt         Q3_access.txt
Q1_added_users.txt    Q3_added_users.txt
Q1_deleted_users.txt  Q3_deleted_users.txt
Q2_access.txt         Q4_access.txt
Q2_added_users.txt    Q4_added_users.txt
Q2_deleted_users.txt  Q4_deleted_users.txt
```

1. Search the Q2_deleted_users.txt file for the username jhill.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt
1025         jhill     Sales
```

2. Search the Q4_added_users.txt file to list the users who were added to the Human Resources department.
```
analyst@959be47f320f:~$ grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt 
1151         sshah     Human Resources
1145         msosa     Human Resources
```
