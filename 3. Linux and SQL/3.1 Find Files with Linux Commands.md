# 3.1: Find Files with Linux

## Scenario
In this scenario, you have to locate and analyze the information of certain files located in the /home/analyst directory.

Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll get the information of the current working directory you’re in and display the contents of the directory. Second, you’ll navigate to the reports directory and list the subdirectories it contains. Third, you’ll navigate to the users subdirectory and display the contents of the Q1_added_users.txt file. Finally, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and display the first 10 lines of a file it contains.
