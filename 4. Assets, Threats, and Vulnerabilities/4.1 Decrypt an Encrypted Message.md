# 4.1: Decrypt an Encrypted Message 

## Scenario
In this scenario, all of the files in your home directory have been encrypted. You’ll need to use Linux commands to break the Caesar cipher and decrypt the files so that you can read the hidden messages they contain.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll explore the contents of the home directory and read the contents of a file. Next, you’ll find a hidden file and decrypt the Caesar cipher it contains. Finally, you’ll decrypt the encrypted data file to recover your data and reveal the hidden message.


### Task 1. Read the contents of a file
1. Use the ls command to list the files in the current working directory.
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ ls
Q1.encrypted  README.txt  caesar
```

2. Use the cat command to list the contents of the README.txt file.
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cat README.txt
Hello,
All of your data has been encrypted. To recover your data, you will need to solve a cipher. To get started look for a hidden file in the caesar subdirectory.
```

### Task 2. Find a hidden file
1. First, use the cd command to change to the caesar subdirectory of your home directory:
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cd caesar
```

2. Use the ls -a command to list all files, including hidden files, in your home directory.
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ ls -a
.  ..  .leftShift3
```

3. Use the cat command to list the contents of the .leftShift3 file.
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cat .leftShift3
Lq rughu wr uhfryhu brxu ilohv brx zloo qhhg wr hqwhu wkh iroorzlqj frppdqg:
rshqvvo dhv-256-fef -sengi2 -d -g -lq T1.hqfubswhg -rxw T1.uhfryhuhg -n hwwxeuxwh
```

4. You can decrypt the Caesar cipher in the .leftshift3 file by using the following command:
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
In order to recover your files you will need to enter the following command:
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
```

6. Now, return to your home directory before completing the next task:
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cd ~
```

7. Use the exact command revealed in the previous task to decrypt the encrypted file:
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
```

8. Use the ls command to list the contents of your current working directory again.
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ ls
Q1.encrypted  README.txt
Q1.recovered  caesar
```

9. Use the cat command to list the contents of the Q1.recovered file
```
analyst@e5fce2dcd555:~$ cat Q1.recovered
If you are able to read this, then you have successfully decrypted the classic cipher text. You recovered the encryption key that was used to encrypt this file. Great work!
```
